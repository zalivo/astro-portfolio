# United Accessbility Dream

TODO: write out the idea
One repository/application where institutions could input information about their art - their conversational agent could access that information and be used PWA by visitors.

# Master Thesis

I worked on my thesis about accessible art with conversational agents (in my case OpenAI wrapper) to elevate the experience of visually impaired in the National Gallery in Prague.
